Before Wear my Rasain Education was very lacking in lessons. But after subscribing to <br>
Rasain Education thank God I was more able to understand the same material taught.<br>
Through the Silat Concept in Rasain Education and his <br> 
learning video can take me through this 2021 SBMPTN at the Jakarta State Polytechnic.Anyway after <br> 
I Wear Rasain Education I understand more about Mathematics, economics etc.</p>

Angelin P. : <br>
Previously I had a UTS value of 70. However, since studying with a private tutor from rasain <br>
education I made up 90. A unique and fun experience with rasain education teachers is made in <br> 
small books whose contents are lattices plus the theory. So it makes it easy for me to get to study.</p>

Kak Dwi is a fun, patient, slang teacher, and a great teacher. Because Kak Dwi always helps <br>
me during the learning process. How to teach it is also okay. Guru Barules is indeed the best</p>

Studying at Rasain Education is very helpful. Moreover, it is at the forefront of UTBK like this.<br> 
How to teach is very easy to understand and the teacher is also very fun.</p>

Grassella Ananda : <br>
Ordering private teachers in the halles is very easy. The teacher is good,fun, and the way <br> 
he teaches and deliveries are good, so far my math grades have also improved for the better.<br>
I used to be my math when I was in middle school a little bad because it took <br>
too long a vacation as long as UN elementary school but now the math grades alone are getting better
